  <div>As the business grew, other buildings in the shopping center were opened. In the early 70's carpet and flooring were added, along with a partner. The name then was changed to Thomas and Jones Furniture Co. By 1976, the furniture store included the entire shopping center. That same year the partner was bought out and Billy Ray's son, Bryan joined the family business. The name then was changed to Thomas and Son Furniture, as is it is now. Over the years, more showroom and warehouse buildings were added to the rear of the shopping center. Now the store consists of 50,000 square feet! In November 1999, Billy Ray's daughter, Rita joined the family business as office manager and product buyer.</div>

  <div>In the early years, Billy Ray and Lovell were committed to selling only quality home furnishings sold at low prices. That commitment still stands true today. We carry all the major brands of furniture and accessories for every room in the house, and we offer a low-price guarantee!
